# Organic Terrain Generation Goals

This project aims to procedurally generate organic, visually interesting, and playable terrain for marble race simulations. The terrain generation system is designed with the following goals:

## Goals

- **Continuity**: The playable area should always be a single, continuous region with no isolated "air pockets" or disconnected open spaces.

- **Organic Structure**: Terrain should look natural and hand-drawn, with flowing paths, smooth curves, and irregular boundaries. There should be no obvious grid patterns or symmetry.

- **Chambers and Corridors**: The main playable space should consist of winding corridors and larger open chambers, creating a sense of exploration and variety.

- **Branching and Loops**: The terrain should allow for occasional branches, dead ends, and loops, making each map unique and interesting to navigate.

- **Islands**: Solid "islands" of terrain should appear within the open space, especially in larger chambers and corridors, adding obstacles and visual interest. These should never disconnect the main playable area.

- **Configurable Complexity**: The overall complexity, width of paths, number and size of chambers, frequency of branches, and number of islands should all be easily adjustable via configuration.

- **No Arenas**: The system should avoid generating very large, empty arenas. The space should be well-structured, with a balance of open and narrow regions.

- **Fairness and Playability**: The generated terrain should support fair and engaging gameplay, with clear paths from start to finish and no impossible or unfair obstacles.

## Non-Goals

- **Aesthetic Mimicry**: The system does not attempt to exactly replicate the visual style of any specific reference image, but instead focuses on structural and gameplay qualities.

- **Manual Editing**: All terrain is generated procedurally, with no need for manual post-processing or hand-tuning.

These goals ensure that every generated map is unique, fun to play, and visually appealing, while remaining fully configurable and robust for simulation and experimentation.
